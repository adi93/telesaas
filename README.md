# Telesaas: Telepathy as a Service

Welcome to "Telesaas", or Telepath as a Service. This service's aim is to help debug those pesky little issues that people create without providing any details. Earlier, you had no way of dealing with such issues, apart from bringing out your favorite swear words at the said person, or sending passive-aggressive mails (in corporate speak, of course. Wouldn't want to be rude) to the said nicompoop.

But no more! After you deploy this service, you will be simply able to read such details from the direct minds of the ticket creator. No more emails, slack, discord, teams, skype, pigeon-carriors, etc. After all, such tools require the person to actively make an effort, which is clearly an unreasonable expectation. Just point them to this service, and viola! You'll get all the relevant details out of their mind.

## How to deploy it
Deployment is simple: Just think hard about deploying it. No other steps required (If it doesn't work, you are not thinking hard enough)

## My customer sent me a screenshot of an slack message which contained another screenshot of an email, where the actual issue details were cropped out. Can this service help here?
Absolutely! This service comes with all the extensions installed to parse different forms of messages (support for skype: tbd). Just think really really hard, and you'll be able to  get the details in no time.

## My client didn't even know which details to send. What do I do know?
You can install the "Xavier" package. This package goes inside the person, and tries to think of relevant details that the person could send you. After all, at no point should the client be expected to think or do the bare minimum. However, be wary: If "Xavier" is not able to find the details, it instead makes the client think that such details are being purposefully hidden by you, making them a little more aggressive.

## Where do I file bugs for this?
Follow the same procedure in "How to deploy it" section.

So, what are you waiting for? Start telling (or rather "thinking") about this service to your favorite client, and see how it dramatically improves your life!
